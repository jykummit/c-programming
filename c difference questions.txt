1.Differentiate between the macros and the functions.
The differences between macros and functions can be explained as follows:

Macros	                                              Functions
1.It is preprocessed rather than compiled.	1.It is compiled not preprocessed.
2.It is preprocessed rather than compiled.	2.Function checks for compilation errors.
3.Code length is increased.	                3.Code length remains the same.
4.Macros are faster in execution.	         4.Functions are a bit slower in execution.
5.Macros are useful when a small piece of code 
is used multiple times in a program.	         5.Functions are helpful when a large piece of code is repeated a number of times.
